# TakeHomeAssessment

 design pattern -> simple MVVM pattern 
 
 UI -> adapter layout 
 
 Glide DI for image cropping and editing
 
 retrofit -> Api service network module 

 Note: GET requests and POST requests are made just as asked in the question.Was trying jitpack.io for image filtering and applying changes but later could'nt build it because of deprecated kotlin extensions and some other versions, so Ive just left the filter page as it is. I think it would've been possible with BitmapDecoding but I found it too complicated in kotlin and lacked time. However I added a download feature which acccesses permissions and file IO. Also by text overlay Im assuming it was to embed text inside the image? that unfortunately I could'nt figure out.
